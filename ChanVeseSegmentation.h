/*
This software contains the C++ implementation of the "branch-and-mincut" framework for image segmentation
with various high-level priors as described in the paper:

V. Lempitsky, A. Blake, C. Rother. Image Segmentation by Branch-and-Mincut. 
In proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), October 2008.

The software contains the core algorithm and an example of its application (globally-optimal 
segmentations under Chan-Vese functional).

Implemented by Victor Lempitsky, 2008
